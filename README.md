## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method that operates on the principles of rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones. In a broader context, a reinforcement learning agent possesses the capability to perceive and comprehend its environment, take actions, and acquire knowledge through a process of trial and error.

### Selected Projects

This repository features a collection of projects that delve into various aspects of reinforcement learning, including the following:

- **Implementation of Learning Algorithms**: Explore the practical implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Reinforcement Comparison and Actor-Critic Models. These algorithms are fundamental in training agents to make decisions that maximize cumulative rewards over time.
